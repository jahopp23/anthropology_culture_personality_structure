<p style="margin:1.00em;">Within the field of anthropology there are many sub-fields, such as linguistic anthropology, forensic anthropology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Cultural anthropologists gather information about cultures and the people inhabiting them. By observing how people live, eat, educate, collaborate, celebrate, etc., anthropologists generate cultural data which can provide insight into how humans in society operate. The field of psychological anthropology (very similar to cultural anthropology) has provided two primary methods of observing personality across cultures: Basic Personality Structure (BPS) and Modal Personal Structure (MPS).</p>

<div class="bps col-lg-12" style="text-align:center;">
        <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;text-align:center;">Basic Personality Structure</h3>

     <div class="card bg-light text-dark">
       <p style="margin: 1.00em"> "Culture is integrated, they say, because all the members of a society share certain early experiences
       that produce a specifiable basic personality structure and because this Basic Personality Structure in turn creates and maintains
       other aspects of culture. This assumption leads to a division of culture into two parts: <em>primary institutions</em>, which produce a
       "common denominator" of basic personality, and <em>secondary institutions</em>, which are produced by the BPS."

        - Philip K. Bock, <em>Rethinking Psychological Anthropology</em>, Second Edition.</p>
</p>
      </div>
    <ul><h5>BPS Model</h5>
   
        <div class="card bg-danger text-white"><h5>Primary Institutions: </h5><p>household form, education, subsistence type.</p></div>
        

     <div class="card bg-dark text-white"> => </div>
  
    <div class="card bg-primary text-white"><h5>Basic Personality: </h5> <p>neurological impulse, unique character traits, coping mechanisms, learned behavior</p></div>
          <div class="card bg-dark text-white"> => </div>
  
    <div class="card bg-success text-white"><li><h5>Secondary Institutions: </h5> <p>cultural practices, religion, politics, ritual.</p></li></div>
    
</ul> 

<p>The above is likened to a flowchart. Primary institutions form the Basic Personality, which then creates the Secondary Institutions.</p>

 <p style="margin:1.00em;">For example, Harold grew up in a low-income urban apartment with his mother and two brothers. His education inspired a passion for building rockets. Harold loved the engineering and physics behind his interest. Harold went on to study Rocket Science when he received his university scholarship.</p>
<p style="margin:1.00em;">In this example, Harold's urban upbringing and family life serve as the 'Primary Institutions' - social structures which influence Harold's character as he matures. These structures instilled in Harold a sense of determination and motivation, or, aspects of his 'Basic Personality' (i.e. Character). Harold's character caused him to excel in his science classes, and to develop a hobby in rockets. His determination and hard-work led to Harold receiving a scholarship from a University where he pursued his career in Rocket Science - the "Secondary Institution", or, the result of A + B..</p>

 <div class="card bg-light text-dark"><p style="margin: 1.00em; font-size:1.50em;">Suppose a group of scientists (i.e. anthropologists, sociologists, data scientists, etc.) seek to gather statistical data 
  amongst a native tribe in Siberia. After a series of conducting both cultural study and data analysis, the scientists are able to generate a series of numbers associated with personalities demonstrated in the native tribe. A sample of the data can be seen as follows: </p>
</div>

                        <div class="card bg-info text-light">
                            <p style="font-size: 2.00em;">[10, 10, 20, 20, 30, 40, 40, 50, 50, 50, 100, 100]</p>
                            <p style="margin: 1.00em;">This array represents the various degrees to which disease was observed in individuals within the native culture. 10 being the "least deadly of diseases", and 100 being "the most deadly".</p>
                      </div>


   <div class="card bg-light text-dark">
                           <p style="margin:1.00em;">What does an array of numbers have to do with anthropology? For a moment, think back to math class, specifically when you had to find the 'mean' and 'mode' of some numbers. Finding the 'mean' of the array would tell us which tell us which personality is the "average" amongst a culture; however, finding the 'mode' would prove which personalities are most <em>frequent</em>. The goal of the Modal Personality Structure is to determine the frequency of personalities amongst culture. Rather than forming a general foundation for personality within culture, Modal Personality Structure can locate more subtle, abstract characteristics of people, in order to determine personality frequencies. </p>

  <h5> Modal Personality Structure Advantages: </h5>
   <ul>
     <li>The MP approach does not assume that all or even most of the members of a society share the same personality structure. The degree of sharing becomes an empricial problem rather than an assertion based on purely cultural data.</li>
     <li>In MP studies, biographical and test data on individuals are invariably collected (and usually published). In theory, such data could be collected by researchers using the Basic Personality Stucture approach. However, since test data always show a wide range of variation, they are much more compatible with an MP approach, which gives careful attention to techniques of sampling and of statistical analysis.</li>

   <div class="col-lg-12">

<div class="question">
    <p>1. What do you think Bock means when he compares the Basic Personality Structure to "the common denominator of the personalities of the individuals who participate in the culture".? 
</div>
<div class="question">
   <p>2. Apply the BPS model to your life. What are some of your Primary Institutions? How do these institutions play a role in your personality? How will your Primary institutions and Basic Personality influence the Secondary Institutions in which you participate in? </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
<p>3. Explain how the Modal Personality is different from the Basic Personality Structure. What are the benefits of the Modal Personality Structure? What are the benefits of the Basic Personality Structure?</p>
</div>
<div class="question">
<p>4. Find the "mode" of the array representing disease frequency in the native culture. What can you conclude based upon your result about the culture?</p>
